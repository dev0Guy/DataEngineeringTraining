## Introduction To Kafka

Imagine a logistics company that starts with a very simple setup: a warehouse system collects package data, processes it, and sends it to the shipping system. At first, one engineer writes the code to extract the data, transform it, and load it into the shipping system. Everything works smoothly.

But as the company grows, things get more complex. Now there are multiple warehouses, multiple shipping partners, billing systems, customer service portals, and analytics tools. Each system uses different technologies, data formats, and protocols. Keeping all of them connected becomes a nightmare. Every new integration requires custom code, and changes in one system can break others.

## How can we solve this problem? 
 
### using **Kafka**!

Kafka acts as a central data pipeline. Instead of building direct connections between every system, all systems connect to Kafka. The warehouse systems publish package data to Kafka. The shipping, billing, analytics, and customer support systems each subscribe to the relevant Kafka topics.

This way:
- 	Systems don’t need to know about each other.
-	Data producers only write to Kafka.
-	Data consumers only read from Kafka.
-	Systems can evolve independently without breaking integrations.

Kafka simplifies data movement across the company — just like a central train station connecting multiple cities.

### Common Kafka Use Cases
1. Messaging System
2. Activity Tracking System
3. Metrics Aggregation
4. Application Logs
5. Stream Processing
6. Decoupling Systems and Microservices
7. Big Data Integration
