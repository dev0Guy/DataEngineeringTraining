# Data Engineering Training

Welcome to the **DataEngineeringTraining** repository!  
This project is a comprehensive, hands-on training suite for aspiring data engineers, featuring exercises and examples in multiple programming languages. It is designed to provide practical experience with real-world tools and concepts used in modern data engineering workflows.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

- `go/` – Exercises in Go
- `java/` – Exercises in Java
- `python/` – Exercises in Python
- `rust/` – Exercises in Rust
- `scala/` – Exercises in Scala
- `resources/` – Core concepts, guides, and exercise descriptions

### 🧠 Concepts and Exercises

- All key **data engineering concepts** are explained in the [`resources/concepts`](resources/concepts) directory.
- Specific **exercise descriptions** and tasks are located in [`resources/exercise/`](resources/exercise/).  
  These guide the implementation tasks across different languages.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To begin working on exercises:
